- Check is max_clients is used???
- thread_pool list: replace casted thread_id byreal structure containing thread_id
- Find memory leak (go valgrind)
- Refactor thread pool to make it reusable for other purposes
- use non-blocking fd??

Info:
* Ctrl+C might not close the process at first try because of the loop in x_epoll_wait()
  => loop while errno==EINTR
*
